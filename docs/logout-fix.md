# Fix: Logout Issues with Multi-Session System

## Problem Description

When logging out from a tab with multiple users logged in different tabs, the following issues occurred:

1. **Logout hanging**: User remained in inconsistent state (logged out but still showing user data)
2. **Role validation errors**: System tried to validate roles during logout process
3. **Sidebar issues**: Items disappeared but logout button remained
4. **Console errors**: "User does not have required role" during logout

## Root Causes

### 1. **Race Conditions During Logout**
- `useAuth` was checking roles while user state was being cleared
- Multiple sources of user data (activeUser, tabUser, contextUser) caused inconsistencies
- UserContext was interfering with logout process

### 2. **State Management Issues**
- User state wasn't cleared immediately in all contexts
- SessionManager was updating activity during logout checks
- Role validation was running on partial user data

### 3. **Auth State Listener Conflicts**
- UserContext auth listener was blocking updates with `isUpdatingRef`
- Multiple components trying to manage the same session

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Improved useAuth Hook** (`hooks/use-auth.ts`)

```typescript
// Fixed role validation to skip during logout
if (!currentUser.rol) {
  console.log('User without role detected - likely in logout process, skipping role validation');
  return;
}

// Improved user priority logic
const currentUser = parentUser || (activeUser === null ? null : (activeUser || tabUser || contextUser));

// Enhanced logout process
const handleLogout = async () => {
  setActiveUser(null);      // Clear local state first
  clearUser();              // Clear UserContext
  await authService.logout(); // Clear SessionManager
  router.push("/login");    // Redirect immediately
};
```

### 2. **Simplified UserContext** (`components/auth/UserContext.tsx`)

```typescript
// Removed blocking isUpdatingRef
// Simplified auth state listener
// Added useUserActions hook for manual cleanup

export function useUserActions() {
  return {
    clearUser: () => context?.setUser?.(null),
    setUser: context?.setUser
  }
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced SessionManager** (`lib/sessionManager.ts`)

```typescript
// Added peekCurrentUser() to avoid side effects
public peekCurrentUser(): AuthUser | null {
  const session = this.getCurrentTabSession()
  return session?.user || null
}

// getCurrentUser() updates activity, peekCurrentUser() doesn't
```

## Flow Improvements

### Before (Problematic)
1. User clicks logout
2. Various state sources still return user data
3. Role validation runs on inconsistent data
4. Errors occur, user gets stuck

### After (Fixed)
1. User clicks logout
2. `setActiveUser(null)` immediately
3. `clearUser()` clears UserContext
4. `authService.logout()` clears SessionManager
5. Skip role validation if no role (logout in progress)
6. Redirect to login immediately

## Key Changes

### ✅ **Immediate State Clearing**
- All user states cleared synchronously before async operations
- No intermediate inconsistent states

### ✅ **Skip Role Validation During Logout**
- Check if user has role before validating
- Assume logout in progress if user exists but no role

### ✅ **Proper User Priority**
- Clear precedence for which user source to use
- `activeUser === null` explicitly means "logged out"

### ✅ **Non-Interfering Context**
- UserContext doesn't block with flags
- Manual cleanup methods available

### ✅ **Side-Effect Free Queries**
- `peekCurrentUser()` for checks without activity updates
- Cleaner separation of concerns

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. **Login with two different users in different tabs**
2. **Logout from either tab** → Should work cleanly without errors
3. **Check console** → No role validation errors during logout
4. **Verify other tab** → Should remain unaffected
5. **Sidebar behavior** → Should clear completely or redirect properly

## Result

- ✅ Clean logout without hanging
- ✅ No console errors during logout
- ✅ Proper sidebar state management
- ✅ Other tabs remain unaffected
- ✅ Immediate redirect to login
